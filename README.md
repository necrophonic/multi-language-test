# multi-language-test

Testing a library with multiple language variants embedded

## Motivation

This repository allows testing of embedding multiple progamming languages into a single repository. The idea being that the clients can pull just the part of the repository they need for their purposes without needing to get the rest of the stuff they can't/won't use.

This facilitates (where appropriate) multiple language implementations of certain common library functions to be used in appropriately coded services.
